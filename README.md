# Pomodoro Technique

This is a time management technique, It helps you stay away from distraction. How is this done?
The technique basically helps you focus on work that need to be done in intervals, typically 25 mins of focus and 5 mins of distraction. Most times this is done in part of four i.e 25 mins focus 5 mins distraction
120 mins in total before going for a longer 15 mins break.

The goal of the technique is to reduce the effect of internal and external interruptions on focus and flow.
